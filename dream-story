What should have happened to Ned was that he should have not been so ignorant about what was going on and realized that being invited to King's Landing was just a trap to kill him.
After arriving to King's Land, Ned attends the funeral of Robert Baratheon and then goes home to Winterfell and lives out the rest of his life reigning as King in the North.
Eventually Winterfell brexits after Daenerys dies and Ned is King in the North.
All the direwolves are safe and live with the Stark kids and Jon Snow pets his damn dog.
